# Tiny Cards

This is just a simple extension that adds a zoom slider to the extra tabs cards. This makes browsing large collections of checkpoints and LoRAs much faster.

The card will grow on hover, so you won't miss any information.

# Installation

Open your A1111 Web UI and go to `Extensions > Install from URL`. Paste in the link to this repo (`https://github.com/SenshiSentou/sd-webui-tinycards.git`), click `Install` and restart the web ui. Badabing badaboom, baby!
