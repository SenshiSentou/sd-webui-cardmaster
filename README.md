# Tiny Cards

This is just a simple extension that adds a zoom slider to the extra tabs cards. This makes browsing large collections of checkpoints and LoRAs much faster.

The card will grow on hover, so you won't miss any information.

# Installation

Open your A1111 web ui and go to `Extensions > Install for URL`. Paste in the link to this repo (`tbd`), click `Install` and restart the web ui.
